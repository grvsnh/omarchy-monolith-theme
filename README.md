# Monolith

Monolith is a minimal, monochrome Omarchy theme focused on clarity and consistency.  
It avoids accent colors and semantic color meanings, using only contrast and luminance
to express hierarchy across the system.

The goal is a calm, distraction-free interface that stays out of the way.
